                        <h4>Is This Retro Food Market the Future of Food?</h4>
			<span class="body">
				New York has seen an explosion in a new type of food experience: the marketplace. These are rather tamer versions of Spanish boqueria or bustling marketplaces the world over, with a very tightly controlled space and often high-end shops. Chelsea Market, Gotham West, Gansevoort Market, Berg'n, Brooklyn Night Bazaar, Hudson Eats, and an upcoming Anthony Bourdain joint are permanent manifestations of the ever-popular pop-up food bazaar, such as Smorgasburg or Madison Square Eats.  Images courtesy Yannis Halkiopoulos But these venues, delicious though they may be, are pretty prosaic. While they do serve some communal purpose and offer a twist on the dining experience, they don't exactly break the mold architecturally. A new proposal by Yannis Halkiopoulos of the University Of Westminster in London seeks to drive the marketplace beyond just a food mall with dining area.  Located at the Brooklyn Navy Yard (a target of urban renewal), "Brooklyn Co-Operative" is a slow-food-inspired marketplace that uses the site's unique architectural history to propel it far out into the food-architecture stratosphere. Halkiopoulos transforms the former officers' housing known as Admirals Row into a reinvented space for food production and consumption. This includes fields, a ...

                        <h4>See A Maze Drawn in Chicago's Lakefront</h4>




			<span class="body">
				Chicago has been in the architectural news quite a bit lately, with much of it surrounding the lakefront area. Between the Chicago Architecture Biennial and the George Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, the Windy City's waterfront will be getting some lake-effect architecture soon. (I know Chicago doesn't get lake-effect snow, but its on the lake, so moving on.)  Image via art.newcity.com However, the city might also be getting one other feather in its cap. Artist Matthew Haussler recently completed what might be the world's longest hand-drawn picture maze, and its subject: Chicago's lakefront. The 73 1/2 feet long by 3 feet tall drawing shows many of the landmarks from downtown's east side, but with the linework forming a navigable labyrinth. There are views of Adler Planetarium and the Field Museum along with park-goers and even a marathoner, who is working his way toward the finish line in Grant Park. A real, live, solvable maze, the panorama takes on another layer of artistic meaning by depicting samaritans doing selfless acts  Image courtesy Matthew Haussler. The drawing will be submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records, and there is a good chance it ...

				“Summer house” is a subtle residence in the wood in Beddingestrand, on the Skåne south coast. The plot is located on a dyke, which forms a coastline but is now overgrown with forest. In summer, it is hot, while in winter, the sea blows fresh and roars. The view opens onto the water in the south and the forest in the north. The building has been positioned as a large wooden deck, which rests on three longitudinal concrete beams. The housing body is built of light wood walls and glass that give the building a distinctive shape, which is integrated with the landscape. This creates a direct vision to the sea and a little more closed to the forest. The terrace slab is nonorganic and belongs to the ground. The foundation is slightly dug into the site, which has been favorable for plant growth. The intention is to leave nature intact as far as possible. So, the flat roof and slab seem to float above the grass and sand, which gives a better vision from the surrounding sea and countryside. The owner of this house became the master of different variety views with a shady north side and a sunny ...

                        <h4>Watercooler Cute: A New Face for Office Kitchens</h4>




			<span class="body">
				You spend all day staring at screens. Wouldn’t it be nice to occasionally look up and see a friendly face?   Going against the current tide of all-too-smart automated kitchens, Moscow-based designers Tanya Repina and Misha Repin go low-tech with LO-LO, a simple suite of wooden “microkitchen” units ideal for storing refreshments around the office. Each oval-shaped unit is specifically geared toward a single appliance and its requisite accessories: The coffee machine unit also has pegs to hang mugs; the microwave unit has cupboards for plates and drawers for cutlery; all of them have holes in the back for running electrical cords.  Sketches highlight its resemblance to a birdhouse. LO-LO, as you maybe guessed from its name, is also saccharinely twee. You can now hide the unsightly watercooler behind a pair of painted semi-circle eyes and a wooden peg or drawer-pull nose. It puts a new face on office gossip. Co-workers are still likely talking trash. via Tanya Repina h/t Contemporist

				A group of 11 undergraduate students from Tecnologico de Monterrey have constructed a parametric pavilion as a final exercise in the class “Tecnologias Avanzadas en la Arquitectura” by Alex Rodriguez. The project started with an algorithm created by one of the students; a pyramidal-shaped component was placed across a vaulted surface, creating a strong differentiation by changing its height. Another algorithm was elaborated to unfold the 195 components into a flat surface to be laser-cut and then folded to generate the pyramidal shape from a single piece of three-millimeter Coroplast. The team carefully assembled the components using an industrial staple gun and plastic cable zip ties and reinforced the structure with PVC pipes that were fixed to the ground. The pavilion will encourage future students to use digital fabrication techniques. Coordinator: Alex Rodriguez Design: Andres Martinez

                            List</h4>




			<span class="body">
				Hot on the heels of the appointment of Aaron Betsky as dean of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, we're excited to hear more news about America's best-known architect: Ten of his masterpieces have been nominated to the United Nation’s World Heritage List. If selected, Wright’s works will join the likes of the Sydney Opera House, the Bauhaus School in Germany, and the city of Brasilia as exemplars of modern architecture on the list of just over 1,000 culturally or naturally significant sites, including everything from forests and mountains to buildings and monuments.  Image via Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy Last week, the US Department of Interior announced that these ten "Key Works of Modern Architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright," as they are officially known, will be considered by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for official listing come summer 2016. All ten Wright buildings are already designated as U.S. National Historic Landmarks, and will join just a few other buildings — Monticello, Independence Hall, Taos Pueblo — among the United States' 22 Heritage Sites. Here are the nominated designs: 1. Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois  {% ...

                            Post-Recession Recovery?</h4>




			<span class="body">
				Rejoice and be merry, for architects are on the rise again! Ok, that statement may be overselling it. Nonetheless, new statistics indicate that a key trio of design and construction sectors — architecture, landscape architecture, and engineering — is continuing a steady recovery following the global financial crisis of 2008. Figures released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) show that average annual employment for firms providing architecture and engineering services rose by around 50,000 jobs last year; we have not yet reached pre-recession levels, but we are getting there.  While the data represented in the graph above is reason to be cautiously optimistic, these growing blue bars belie the stark variation in fortunes from sector to sector. The full set of data has been dissected and published by Architect Magazine, which looks not only at the overall health of the industry, but also highlights which disciplines are recovering more quickly than others. Take a look at the breakdown below.   The numbers make most pleasant reading for those in engineering and drafting services, which have been amongst the most resilient sectors in the construction industry during the ...

			<span class="body">
				The site is located in a residential district, which is easily accessible from a principal road. It is a so-called “flagpole-shaped site,” meaning that the rectangular site is located at some distance from the public road and linked to it by a long and narrow path. The site is surrounded by two- and three-story buildings on the four sides. The client requested an indoor garage, so that he can enjoy looking at his beloved car from the living room, and also an inclined roof with solar panels. We decided to build a one-story wood house for two reasons: the floor area requested by the client was relatively small in comparison to the site area and the allowable bearing capacity of the ground soil was low because the land had been used for farming and, therefore, the building had to be lightweight with a relatively large building area. Our biggest challenge was to provide natural light inside the one-story house and also to ensure enough solar energy on the roof in the congested area surrounded by two- and three-story buildings. It was also essential to design the house in harmony with the surrounding townscape. Therefore, the roof design became the key ...

                <span class="body">“The unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence,” wrote Italo Calvino in his masterpiece Invisible Cities. Beyond designing the Ecole Normale Supérieure Cachan in Paris and the Columbia University Campus Plan in New York City, architect Renzo Piano has spent last year looking for fragments of happy cities around Italian suburbs with a team of six young architects.  In August 2013, the 77-year-old architect was named “Senator for life” by Giorgio Napolitano, the President of Italy. Reinforcing the role of political engagement in society, Piano decided to invest his funds as politician to develop a plan to rescue periferies, or the suburban areas of major cities: “I was wondering: Me, an architect who reads about politics on the newspapers, what could I do for my Country? [...] I said to myself: architect is a political profession, after all the word politics is coming from polis, the city […] So my answer was: what I am going to do is a long-term project, as my role of senator for life will be […] I guess that the big project for my Country is the one that include periphery: the city is our future, ...</span>

To guarantee a certain amount of privacy in the glass pavilion, perforated solid larch wood shutters were attached to the east façade oriented to the orchard (and the street). These create a filter between the indoors and outdoors and can easily be opened in only two steps.   </span>

                <h4>Public vs. Private: In Praise of the Taxpaying Patron</h4>

                <span class="body">The ingenious philanthropic model of the public/private partnership has long sustained America’s cultural and civic assets, relied upon by museums, historic places, parks, hospitals, and libraries for design, building, and ongoing program operations. The model constitutes the core of the nation’s uniquely market-reliant nonprofit sector — it is the bedrock of civic goodwill and public benefit. This tradition dates back at least to 1869, when a burgeoning City of New York first gave land on the western edge of its new Central Park, along with construction funds, for the recently incorporated American Museum of Natural History. Architect J. Wrey Mould conceived the first, long-subsumed Gothic Revival structure. Five years later, the City did the same for the Metropolitan Museum of Art across the Park on Fifth Avenue; its initial architectural iteration by Calvert Vaux can still be detected by an informed eye. Both museums were launched in this symbiotic public/private manner in accordance with the Central Park Commission’s 1857 “Greensward Plan.” Olmsted and Vaux’s winning proposal called for for the placement of such buildings on street-accessible edges as places “to humanize, educate, and refine a practical and laborious people.”  Metropolitan Museum of Art.
