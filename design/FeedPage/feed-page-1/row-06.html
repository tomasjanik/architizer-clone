            <h4>Rana Plaza: An Architecture of Disaster</h4>
            <span class="body">On April 24th, 2013, the building known as Rana Plaza, located in the town of Savar, Bangaladesh, collapsed. The structure housed clothing factories and shops crammed into poorly planned space where around 5,000 people total were employed. The factories in the building supplied garments to companies including Benetton, Primark, and Walmart.  Cranes were brought in to assist in the cleanup effort. The work day began as it would, but with a hint of anxiety owing to the fact that the building had been evacuated the previous day due to structural concerns and cracks in the wall. Workers nevertheless filed into the building that morning because factory managers had threatened to withhold their wages if they did not show up for work. Shortly before 9 a.m., a tremor that witnesses said felt like an earthquake rocked the building as it collapsed around its occupants. Rescue personnel arrived on the scene and attempted to find survivors and remove them from the rubble. The collapsed building remained unstable, a pile of concrete rubble, clothes, and machinery. Authorities needed to move as quickly as possible to find survivors, meaning that rescue efforts were dangerous and involved long, grueling hours of ...</span>

            <h4>Dreamscapes: 8 Imaginary Cities from the Mystical Minds of Concept Artists</h4>

            <span class="body">Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut’s fantastical structures and futuristic urban landscapes are not to everyone’s liking, but one thing is for sure: They always get the internet talking. His latest images are a case in point, portraying Paris as an über green metropolis, populated with vertical farms, towers powered by photosynthesis and apartments made up of tessellating honeycomb modules, fused with traditional residential blocks.  © Vincent Callebaut Architectures. Via designboom Inhabitable bridges soar across the Seine, whilst tree-like structures entwined with mangrove plants spiral overhead. Weaving between the luscious high-rises, a spiderweb of monorails completes Callebaut’s outrageously utopian vision of sustainable architecture and infrastructure. Given Parisian resistance to tall buildings following the debacle that was Tour Montparnasse — a tower voted the second ugliest building in the world on Virtual Tourist in 2008 — it seems far-fetched in the extreme to imagine that the concept designer’s forest of skyscrapers could possibly become reality, no matter how green they may be.  © Vincent Callebaut Architectures. Via designboom Nevertheless, much of Callebaut’s work is intended to get people talking about environmental issues within the built environment, and on this point alone, his renderings must be ...</span>

        <h4>Kindergarten Cerkvenjak</h4>
        <span class="byline"><span class="by">by</span> superform</span>
        <span class="body">The proposed kindergarten is in the village of Cerkvenjak, which is located in the center of the Slovenske Gorice region, Slovenia. The proposed kindergarten is also inseparably connected with the natural surroundings of the trees and playground equipment. The concept of the kindergarten is similar to its local surroundings with the rhythmic string of volumes and roofs. Because of this concept, the kindergarten does not surpass the scale of an individual house and gives the user — a child — a sense of home. The proposed kindergarten design originated from an existing learning path, which runs nearby. The kindergarten is a new program and function that upgrades the existing learning path. The result of using the principle of a learning path is a unique division and rhythm of the playrooms. The kindergarten offers rich experience to children and is closer to the scale of the child.   </span>
