                <h4>NYLO New York City</h4>
                <h5 class="byline"><em>by</em> Stonehill &amp; Taylor Architects</h5>
			<span class="body">
				NYLO New York City is the first luxury hospitality brand located in the quintessentially New York neighborhood the Upper West Side. Stonehill &amp; Taylor’s architecture and design team led the complete renovation of the property with a boutique approach inspired by the historic location. Coupled with the NYLO brand’s industrial look, the design team reimagined the public spaces to reflect the energy and colors of New York’s Jazz Era, a nod to the thriving clubs and speakeasies of the 1920s, venues synonymously linked to the uptown locale. The team worked to revive the dynamism and elegance of this era in their design, offering locals and tourists alike an experience authentic to NYC. The design team utilized the existing outdoor space as well as a variety of underutilized rooms to completely reorganize and expand the public areas. The lobby has four distinct areas loosely partitioned to give a sense of action while offering intimate settings. The apothecary-styled reception area features shelving and artifacts reminiscent of the personalized service of this age; the Conservatory provides a space to enjoy live jazz over drinks, a mood set by a polished red piano, wood paneling, tufted seating, and metal finishes; the Library offers a ...

                <h4>Shell Shock: The Last Clamshell Gas Station Standing</h4>




			<span class="body">
				When Walter Dorwin Teague designed the Texaco gas stations for the Texas Centennial fair in 1935, he sought to redefine the experience of a road-trip pit-stop. They were white with forest-green streamline stripes and made the experience of filling up almost seamless, like a NASCAR pit row. The storied industrial designer emphasized usability, but other companies attracted motorists through means other than hardcore modernism. Case in point, Quality Oil built several Shell stations in Winston-Salem, N.C., that are clamshells-as-advertisements, hailing customers through their distinctive shape and bright colors.  Image via Atlas Obscura The station is literally a logo-become-a-building. The figurative form and bright primary coloration effectively render it an example large-scale graphic design. In contrast with Teague's Texaco stations, the building serves as the sign, while Teague's more traditional architecture was essentially a decorated shed. The Shell Station incorporates proper architectural proportions and detailing, applied to a more straightforward building. (Texaco's logo was also designed by Teague and attached to a pole.)  Walter Dorwin Teague-designed Texaco Station. Image via luckymojo.com Like many mid-century filling stations, they are not gas pumps any more: As with Googie stations (Modernist icons of yesteryear), the clamshells ...

                <h4>F-18</h4>
                <h5 class="byline"><em>by</em> Cyrille Druart</h5>
			<span class="body">
				In January 2015, I-WAY, a unique venue dedicated to high-end car simulation located in Lyon, France, presents its biggest innovation since the opening in 2008: F-18 Super Hornet plane simulators. After the US Army’s, they are the most advanced plane simulators in the world and are now available to the public. French designer Cyrille Druart, architect of the original building, redesigned a large space, plunging the three jewels in the dark. “The way the building is designed allowed us to have a direct view from the upper level over the new simulators. A concrete wall was opened and a 20-foot-long glazed surface installed.” The advantage is twofold. On one hand, the direct vision informs visitors of novelty and also creates a new dimension, the 23-foot wall being previously windowless. The interior is made of a concrete wall in front of which are aligned the new simulators. LED lines echo the wall, indicating directions, and spotlights enhance the space. “The original idea is from Pierre Nicolas, the company’s CEO. He wanted to create the same excitement we did six years ago. We have integrated the F-18 simulators in the most discrete and uniform possible way, as if they had always been ...
