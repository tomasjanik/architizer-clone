Coupled with the NYLO brand’s industrial look, the design team reimagined the public spaces to reflect the energy and colors of New York’s Jazz Era, a nod to the thriving clubs and speakeasies of the 1920s, venues synonymously linked to the uptown locale. The team worked to revive the dynamism and elegance of this era in their design, offering locals and tourists alike an experience authentic to NYC. The design team utilized the existing outdoor space as well as a variety of underutilized rooms to completely reorganize and expand the public areas. The lobby has four distinct areas loosely partitioned to give a sense of action while offering intimate settings. The apothecary-styled reception area features shelving and artifacts reminiscent of the personalized service of this age; the Conservatory provides a space to enjoy live jazz over drinks, a mood set by a polished red piano, wood paneling, tufted seating, and metal finishes; the Library offers a ..."

They were white with forest-green streamline stripes and made the experience of filling up almost seamless, like a NASCAR pit row. The storied industrial designer emphasized usability, but other companies attracted motorists through means other than hardcore modernism. Case in point, Quality Oil built several Shell stations in Winston-Salem, N.C., that are clamshells-as-advertisements, hailing customers through their distinctive shape and bright colors.  Image via Atlas Obscura The station is literally a logo-become-a-building. The figurative form and bright primary coloration effectively render it an example large-scale graphic design. In contrast with Teague's Texaco stations, the building serves as the sign, while Teague's more traditional architecture was essentially a decorated shed. The Shell Station incorporates proper architectural proportions and detailing, applied to a more straightforward building. (Texaco's logo was also designed by Teague and attached to a pole.)  Walter Dorwin Teague-designed Texaco Station.

After the US Army’s, they are the most advanced plane simulators in the world and are now available to the public. French designer Cyrille Druart, architect of the original building, redesigned a large space, plunging the three jewels in the dark. “The way the building is designed allowed us to have a direct view from the upper level over the new simulators. A concrete wall was opened and a 20-foot-long glazed surface installed.” The advantage is twofold. On one hand, the direct vision informs visitors of novelty and also creates a new dimension, the 23-foot wall being previously windowless. The interior is made of a concrete wall in front of which are aligned the new simulators. LED lines echo the wall, indicating directions, and spotlights enhance the space. “The original idea is from Pierre Nicolas, the company’s CEO. He wanted to create the same excitement we did six years ago. We have integrated the F-18 simulators in the most discrete and uniform possible way, as if they had always been ..."

It is not clear if the retailer's demise is the extension of America's dying-mall crisis, just extended to the Sky(Mall), or if there was some kind of cultural shift away from ordering in-flight when you could wait until you were home and get it cheaper on Amazon.

A sculptural stair punctuates the sinuous movement of the house, while a glass bridge reconnects the two upstairs wings. An elegant palette of contrasting materials contributes to the expansive feeling of this home. The backyard has a courtyard feel and a curved pool echoes the form of the central volume drawing attention through the house."

Douglas fir is used throughout the store and finished in different ways to define space and function. Pickled vertical slats line the café walls creating a soft warm shell while ebonized and oiled wood defines the various functions within the space. Conceived as a matryoshka doll, the coffee bar is nestled inside a Douglas fir volume whose ‘top’ has been lifted. The ‘top’ is set at eight feet high, providing a more intimate experience between barista and customer. Highlighting the lab-like quality of Intelligentsia’s process, white quartz countertops and an illuminated polycarbonate ceiling create the lining inside the nesting doll and further distinguish and define the coffee bar."

At first, it seemed like an epic task, like the time Caity Weaver spent 14 hours at TGI Friday's eating mozzarella sticks. I braced myself for some kind of mind-bending, eye-watering marathon test of endurance. Once I'd downloaded the game, I dove right in. It's a little glitchy, so you have to choose \"Windowed,\" or it will reset the whole thing if you try to exit.

Among the best were Chanel’s Karl Lagerfeld with his exotic paper terrarium and Giorgio Armani’s oriental-inspired, bamboo-lined catwalk, not to mention the OMA-designed Prada show. But perhaps the most architecturally interesting set design seen last week was Raf Simon’s runway maze of white scaffolding for French fashion house Christian Dior.  Photo via The New York Times   Photos via The Guardian His spring collection, shown Jan. 26 at the Musée Rodin, comprised a series of 1950s-70s couture made futuristic with ribbon-ringed pleated skirts, sequined minidresses, clear plastic coats, and boldly patterned bodysuits.

The structure housed clothing factories and shops crammed into poorly planned space where around 5,000 people total were employed. The factories in the building supplied garments to companies including Benetton, Primark, and Walmart.  Cranes were brought in to assist in the cleanup effort. The work day began as it would, but with a hint of anxiety owing to the fact that the building had been evacuated the previous day due to structural concerns and cracks in the wall. Workers nevertheless filed into the building that morning because factory managers had threatened to withhold their wages if they did not show up for work. Shortly before 9 a.m., a tremor that witnesses said felt like an earthquake rocked the building as it collapsed around its occupants. Rescue personnel arrived on the scene and attempted to find survivors and remove them from the rubble. The collapsed building remained unstable, a pile of concrete rubble, clothes, and machinery.

His latest images are a case in point, portraying Paris as an über green metropolis, populated with vertical farms, towers powered by photosynthesis and apartments made up of tessellating honeycomb modules, fused with traditional residential blocks.  © Vincent Callebaut Architectures. Via designboom Inhabitable bridges soar across the Seine, whilst tree-like structures entwined with mangrove plants spiral overhead. Weaving between the luscious high-rises, a spiderweb of monorails completes Callebaut’s outrageously utopian vision of sustainable architecture and infrastructure. Given Parisian resistance to tall buildings following the debacle that was Tour Montparnasse — a tower voted the second ugliest building in the world on Virtual Tourist in 2008 — it seems far-fetched in the extreme to imagine that the concept designer’s forest of skyscrapers could possibly become reality, no matter how green they may be.  © Vincent Callebaut Architectures.
