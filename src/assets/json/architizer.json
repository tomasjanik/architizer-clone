      "author": "",
      "paragraph": "The Architects’ Journal recently published an enigmatic set of renderings, displaying what architect Richard Weston describes as a new genre of high-rise building: the \"contextual tower.\" The angular skyscraper — officially named after its address, 1 Undershaft — is intended to correlate closely with its surroundings, its form dictated by a careful analysis of adjacent masses to create a structure that combines maximum leasable floor space with the lowest possible visual impact. As low an impact as you can achieve with a 250-meter high building, at least… Via The Architects\u0027 Journal Designed by Brian Avery of Avery Associates, the skyscraper’s wedge-shaped silhouette is informed primarily by protected viewing corridors towards Christopher Wren’s historic St. Paul’s Cathedral, and the nearby Leadenhall Building, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. In fact, it appears to have taken substantial design cues from RSHP\u0027s landmark tower, affectionately nicknamed the Cheesegrater: As well as massing and orientation, its lattice of structural steelwork and glazing makes it a stylistic extension of the tower next door. The head of planning for London’s Square Mile for the past 30 years, Peter Rees has likened the City’s skyline to a mountain range, and the cluster’s ..."

      "paragraph": "The home is situated along the top of a gently sloping ridge in the property, which minimized the impact to the site but maximized views and solar orientation. The home’s simple L-shape provides a natural division of exterior public and private space, which is simply landscaped to complement the austerity of the architecture. Functionally, this L-shaped plan provides a linear organization of approximately 2,000-square-feet of living and sleeping spaces, which are linked by an entry foyer to a two-car garage. The goal internally was to provide a sense of openness between rooms and accentuate the perception of the interior volume. The use of butt joint glazing atop walls provides sound control and privacy yet also allows light to stream through the entire interior rather than merely in each individual room. Simple use of built-in wardrobes, cabinetry, pocket doors, and other space-saving features provided great efficiency and accentuated the internal modern character. Formally, the shed provided a means to capture sunlight along the high southern wall, creating a more dramatic presence to the public side, with a more intimate scale for the rear courtyard. Protected by an eight-foot-deep overhang, the southern wall remains fully shaded during the summer yet allows sunlight ..."

A house with dynamic spatial and material qualities: from an unlimited space with panoramic views of nature to private rooms hidden behind a veil of shutters, from sleek custom furniture against a raw concrete structure to warm timber paired with cold steel. Light and views were key elements of this design. The house was completed in January 2014. Situated directly on the waterfront with unobstructed views of the opposite park, Kavel 01 (meaning Lot 01) is what you could call a dream site, but one that posed a tough challenge: how do we build a spacious, livable home on a sharp diamond-shaped plot on this most beautiful part on the island? It seemed impractical to combine a simple rectangular volume with an angular plot with sharp angles of 51 degrees — and also did little justice to its unique form — so we based the design of the house on the shape of a diamond. On the north side, the volume is pushed toward the tip of the ..."

Their design for a chain of hotels is one of the weirdest yet, in a very good way. Each one is shaped — in the most blatant way — like a giant chunk of the gemstone amethyst. These quartz buildings are cut in half to reveal a purple crystalline surface. The concave façade gives each room a faceted window and interior, and is meant to invoke the healing qualities of amethyst. The large void is made of many angled glass panes, making it so much like a crystal that it\u0027s making me giddy. Each hotel will be part of a branded scheme that includes buildings in cities, on islands, and along coastlines, each a glowing, shimmering rock.

Its presence in public space is fundamental because the other public functions — the residential care center St-Augustinus, the OCMW administration, and the firehouse — are correlated on the Aartrijkestraat. The design visually lifts itself up from the ground, creating a vast covered outdoor space where all sorts of common activities can take place. The glazed convex shape forms a diffuse transition between park and building. The public outdoor space becomes a public indoor place. The functionalities of the imposed program are situated in a compact concentric plan: a strictly geometric and square shape in which the atrium forms the heart of the building. This atrium is an open-plan area that spatially connects all floors and allows light to reach down to the ground floor."

São Paulo, Brazil might be the latest city to find a patch of elevated greenery in the dense metropolitan fabric. The question is, do they reeeally want one? The answer is looking like a \"yes,\" given the current status of a piece of highway that would be perfect for a park, Elevado Presidente Costa e Silva. Known as the Minhocão (Big Worm), the intensely unpopular stretch of road hovers above a 2-mile stretch of dense neighborhoods and has a dubious history: Built in 1971 by Mayor Paulo Maluf — who is wanted on international conspiracy charges — it is said that he erected the road to get from his house to work without stop lights. It starts in front of his house, and snakes through the city with no on or off ramps. Today the Minhocão is only open to traffice from 6:30am to 9:30pm, Monday to Saturday. This leaves the highway vacant for large amounts of time, giving the locals a chance to make it their own.

      "paragraph": "A member of Meyer Sound’s LEO™ Family of linear loudspeakers, the self-powered LYON™ linear line array loudspeaker is designed to faithfully reproduce audio with tremendous power and clarity and without coloring the sound — even when pushed to the limit. LYON utilizes the same cutting-edge technology as the acclaimed LEO-M, delivering very high headroom and precision coverage, yet it is housed in a lighter and more compact cabinet. LYON is ideal for medium- to large-scale array applications that do not require the extreme long-throw capability of LEO-M. LYON is available in two models: LYON-M for primary array coverage and LYON-W for wide coverage. LYON-W can be used wherever wide coverage is needed in LYON arrays, at the bottom or in the middle of primary arrays, or even at the top of outfill arrays. LYON arrays are ideally paired with Meyer Sound’s 1100-LFC low-frequency control element for bass reproduction. Entire systems are driven by Meyer Sound’s Galileo® Callisto™ loudspeaker management system, which provides matrix routing, alignment, and processing for array components. LYON provides the integrator with a reliable, high-performance installation solution for the largest and most demanding audio reinforcement projects, such as arenas, performing arts centers, theatres, and churches.

The two worlds intersect in the eclectic and variegated interiors of the labels’ flagship stores — architecture may not be subject to the biannual cycles of fashion, but it certainly goes a long way toward complementing the aesthetic of a brand. Here is a collection of stunning showrooms that express the cosmopolitan spirit of the city: Fashion and design addicts alike should take note of this short guide around the fashion district for your next trip to Milan. Photo credit: Jacopo Spilimbergo Dame Zaha left her imprint in Via Sant’Andrea, 10/A at the new Stuart Weitzman boutique, inaugurated last September. Modular display units showcase shoes and, at the same time, turn into seating. Hadid’s futuristic cave is organized into two separates spaces characterized by a monochromatic spotless atmosphere.

A new, simple volume, integrated alongside the existing building, accommodates educational, recreational, and rest spaces that open directly to the smart garden. The windows of the new building have been strictly designed in close relationship with the interior and exterior and elements such as loggias — bow windows and skylights allow children to enjoy the garden in the wintertime. On the roof is another garden divided into different thematic areas. In the heart of the building, a glazed patio brings light into the space."

While that was a small project that is but a sliver of space compared to his buildings today, its novel reorientation of both the gallery space and the public streetscape via an architectural gesture — a dynamic façade — has set the course for his oeuvre of over 20 museum projects over the past two decades. The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. All images courtesy Steven Holl Architects. Holl\u0027s latest project is The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, which continues in Holl\u0027s signature style with elegant and subtly light-drenched spaces, custom-fitted to a historic and complex site. Here, the New York-based architect picks up where he left off with the 1998 Cranbrook Institute of Science and 2007 Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, among other cultural institutions designed by his firm.
